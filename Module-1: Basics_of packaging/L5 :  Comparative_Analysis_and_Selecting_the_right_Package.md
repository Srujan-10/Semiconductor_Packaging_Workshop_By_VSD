## üß† Types of Interposers

Interposers come in various configurations depending on the number of chips, materials used, and whether they include Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs). Below are key types:

### üîπ 1. Based on Chip Configuration

#### ‚úÖ Single-Chip Interposer
- Designed to interface **one chip** to the substrate.
- Simpler routing and lower cost.
- Common in basic silicon bridge designs.

#### ‚úÖ Multi-Chip Interposer
- Supports **multiple dies** side-by-side.
- Enables high-density integration (e.g., CPU + HBM).
- Used in 2.5D and heterogeneous integration platforms.

### üîπ 2. Based on Material and Thickness

#### ‚úÖ Thin-Film Interposer
- Ultra-thin layers (often below 100 ¬µm).
- Uses advanced photolithography and deposition.
- Enables high-resolution fine-pitch routing.

#### ‚úÖ Organic Interposer
- Made from resin-based material (e.g., Ajinomoto build-up film).
- Lower cost than silicon; lower performance.
- Suitable for high-volume, mid-range applications.

#### ‚úÖ Inorganic Interposer (e.g., Silicon, Glass)
- High electrical performance and precision.
- Can integrate TSVs.
- Preferred for high-end SoCs, GPUs, FPGAs.

### üîπ 3. Based on TSV (Through-Silicon Via) Usage

#### ‚úÖ TSV-less Interposer
- No vertical vias; relies on horizontal routing or RDL.
- Cheaper and simpler to manufacture.
- Used in 2.1D and some fan-out techniques.

#### ‚úÖ Passive TSV Interposer
- Acts only as a **routing medium**.
- TSVs connect dies to the substrate; **no active circuitry**.
- Most common in 2.5D ICs (e.g., AMD Fiji GPU).

#### ‚úÖ Active TSV Interposer
- Includes **active circuits** like buffers, decoupling capacitors, power regulation.
- Can reduce latency and improve signal integrity.
- More complex and expensive; emerging in next-gen 3D SoCs.

## üîç Key Decision Factors

- **Form Factor:** Use CSP or QFN for tiny footprints.
- **Thermal / Electrical Performance:** Use LGA, Flip-Chip BGA, or 2.xD if power is high.
- **Integration Level:** Use 2.1D or above for chiplets/multi-die systems.
- **Cost Sensitivity:** Stick to QFN/QFP/PGBA if you want low cost.
- **Cutting-edge AI / HPC:** Choose CoWoS or 2.5D for maximum integration and bandwidth.
