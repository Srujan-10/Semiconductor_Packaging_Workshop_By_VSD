## ðŸ§ª Front-End Exit: Wafer Leaves Fab

The wafer, containing multiple dies (chips), exits the fabrication facility after front-end processing is complete.

## ðŸ§¼ Backend Process Flow

### 1. **Probe Testing**
- Electrical test performed on each die while still on the wafer.
- Identifies good dies for packaging.

### 2. **Die Inking**
- Failed dies are marked (inked) to avoid packaging them.

### 3. **Wafer Thinning & Cleaning**
- Reduces wafer thickness to meet packaging needs.
- Ensures flatness and removes contaminants.

### 4. **Wafer Bake**
- Removes moisture from the wafer before further processing.

### 5. **Wafer Dicing**
- The wafer is cut into individual dies using a blade or laser.

## ðŸ”§ Assembly & Packaging

### 6. **Pick and Place**
- Good dies are picked and placed onto the package substrate.

### 7. **Die Attach / Eutectic Reflow**
- Die is attached to the substrate using **epoxy** or **eutectic bonding**.
- Eutectic bonding involves a metal alloy (often gold-silicon) that melts and reflows to attach the die securely.

### 8. **Wire Bonding**
- Gold or aluminum wires connect the die pads to the package leads.
- Bonding ensures electrical connectivity.

### 9. **Lid Seal / Sealing**
- A **ceramic lid** is placed over the die in the **ceramic package body**.
- Lid is hermetically sealed to protect the microcircuit.

### 10. **Lead Trimming & Forming**
- Metal leads or pins are trimmed and formed into the correct shape for PCB mounting.

### 11. **Part Marking**
- Package is laser marked with identification details (e.g., lot code, part number).

## âœ… Final Stage

### 12. **Part Ready for Electrical Testing**
- The packaged device is now ready for:
  - Open/short testing
  - Burn-in testing
  - Final electrical test
  - Reliability screening
