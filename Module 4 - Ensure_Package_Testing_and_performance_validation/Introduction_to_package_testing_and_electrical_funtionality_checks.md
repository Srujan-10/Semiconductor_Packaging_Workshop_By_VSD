#  Semiconductor Manufacturing and Testing Process (Simplified)

This guide explains the full process of making and testing a chip — from raw silicon to final system testing.

---

## 1️ Front-End Manufacturing (Foundry)

- Wafers are made in cleanrooms.
- Transistors and circuits are built on silicon.
- This process is called **wafer fabrication**.

---

## 2️ Wafer Probe Test

- Tiny needles (probe cards) touch each chip on the wafer.
- Basic electrical tests are done.
- Good chips are marked or mapped.
  
---

## 3️ Wafer Sorting

- The test results are used to separate:
  - **Good dies** (for packaging)
  - **Bad dies** (rejected)

---

## 4️ Package Manufacturing (OSAT)

- Chips are sent to OSAT companies for packaging.
- Steps include:
  - Die attach
  - Wire bonding or flip-chip
  - Molding and marking

---

## 5️ Package Testing

- Electrical tests are done after packaging.
- Verifies if the chip works correctly.
- Includes stress tests like:
  - High temperature
  - Voltage testing
  - ESD (Electrostatic Discharge)

---

## 6️ System-Level Testing (SLT)

- Packaged chips are tested in real systems.
- Ensures the chip works in practical use cases.
- Catches bugs missed in earlier stages.

---

## 7️ Process Development

- Engineers improve and tune each step.
- Helps make better, faster, and more reliable chips.

---

## 8️ Diagnosis & Failure Analysis

- If something fails, engineers find out why.
- Uses tools like:
  - X-rays
  - Microscopes
- Helps fix design or process problems.

##  1. Processing Zone (Clean Room: ISO Class 6 & 7)

- This is where the **main packaging operations** happen.
- Cleanrooms maintain very low dust levels to avoid contamination.
- Key processes done here:
  - Die bonding
  - Wire bonding or flip-chip bonding
  - RDL (Redistribution Layer) formation
  - Encapsulation (molding)
- Inspections are regularly done during and after these processes.

---

##  2. Inspection Area

- Integrated into the process flow.
- Used to check:
  - Bond quality
  - Die alignment
  - Surface defects
  - Overall package quality

> ✅ Packages are loaded onto trays after singulation (separating them from the wafer or panel).

---

##  3. Testing Area

- Chips are tested **after packaging**.
- Tests include:
  - Electrical functionality
  - Burn-in (high temperature stress)
  - Reliability (long-term usage checks)
- Equipment includes:
  - Test boards
  - Sockets for each package type
  - Chambers for thermal cycling

#  Assembly Open and Short Test (AOST)

## Objective
Perform a **quick electrical and visual check** immediately after assembly to identify major defects such as shorts, opens, or physical damage on package leads or solder balls.

---

##  When is AOST Performed?

- **After Trim and Form** (for lead-frame packages)
- **After Singulation** (for BGA and similar packages)

---

##  AOST Checks

1. **Electrical Open/Short Test**
   - Detects:
     - Shorts between pins/balls
     - Opens (no continuity)

2. **Vision Inspection**
   - Detects:
     - Missing or damaged solder balls/leads
     - Cracks or surface defects

---

##  Product Grade Sort (PGSRT)

Packages are sorted based on test results:

| Grade | Description     |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1     | Best            |
| 2     | Better          |
| 3     | Usable/Acceptable |
| 4     | Scrap/Failed    |

> Only Grade 1–3 packages proceed to final test or shipment.

---

##  Summary

- AOST is the **last checkpoint in assembly** before test.
- It ensures **gross assembly failures** are caught early.
- Helps reduce defective parts reaching customers.

#  FCBGA Package Warpage and Electrical Testing

This section describes the issues related to warpage in FCBGA packaging and the steps taken to perform quick electrical checks before final testing or shipment.

---

##  Warpage Behavior

- **FCBGA Package**: Tends to **concave (-)** when cooled.
- **PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**: Often **convex (+)** during reflow.

> This mismatch can lead to poor solder joints or opens during board mounting.

---

##  Objective of Initial Testing

To quickly detect **massive electrical failures** such as:
- **Shorts**
- **Opens**
- **Broken or missing solder balls/leads**

This step happens right after:
- **Trim and Form** (for lead-frame packages)
- **Singulation** (for BGA packages)

---

##  Open/Short Test

- Detects **electrical opens and shorts** in package leads or solder balls.
- Prevents failed chips from reaching customers.

---

##  Visual Inspection

- Checks for physical defects such as:
  - Missing balls
  - Damaged leads
  - Misalignment
  - Surface cracks

---

##  Product Grade Sort (PGSRT)

Packages are graded based on assembly-related defects:

| Grade | Description     |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1     | Best quality    |
| 2     | Better          |
| 3     | Good/usable     |
| 4     | Scrap/Fail      |

---

##  Common Defects

- **Die Crack**: Crack in the silicon die.
- **Short**: Unwanted electrical connection between traces/balls.
- **Open**: No electrical connection.
- **Head-on-Pillow (HoP)**: Ball touches pad but doesn’t bond electrically.
- **Bridging**: Solder connects two adjacent balls/leads.
- **Non-Wet Open (NWO)**: Solder doesn't wet the pad properly.

---

##  Key Stack Components

- **Die** (chip)
- **Package Substrate**
- **PCB (Printed Circuit Board)**

##  Terms

- **Package Board**: A test board where packaged chips are mounted during electrical testing.
- **Package Socket**: Special connectors that hold the chip in place for repeatable and safe testing.
