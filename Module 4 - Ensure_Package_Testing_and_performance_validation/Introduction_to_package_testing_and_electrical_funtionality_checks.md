#  Semiconductor Manufacturing and Testing Process (Simplified)

This guide explains the full process of making and testing a chip — from raw silicon to final system testing.

---

## 1️⃣ Front-End Manufacturing (Foundry)

- Wafers are made in cleanrooms.
- Transistors and circuits are built on silicon.
- This process is called **wafer fabrication**.

---

## 2️⃣ Wafer Probe Test

- Tiny needles (probe cards) touch each chip on the wafer.
- Basic electrical tests are done.
- Good chips are marked or mapped.
  
---

## 3️⃣ Wafer Sorting

- The test results are used to separate:
  - **Good dies** (for packaging)
  - **Bad dies** (rejected)

---

## 4️⃣ Package Manufacturing (OSAT)

- Chips are sent to OSAT companies for packaging.
- Steps include:
  - Die attach
  - Wire bonding or flip-chip
  - Molding and marking

---

## 5️⃣ Package Testing

- Electrical tests are done after packaging.
- Verifies if the chip works correctly.
- Includes stress tests like:
  - High temperature
  - Voltage testing
  - ESD (Electrostatic Discharge)

---

## 6️⃣ System-Level Testing (SLT)

- Packaged chips are tested in real systems.
- Ensures the chip works in practical use cases.
- Catches bugs missed in earlier stages.

---

## 7️⃣ Process Development

- Engineers improve and tune each step.
- Helps make better, faster, and more reliable chips.

---

## 8️⃣ Diagnosis & Failure Analysis

- If something fails, engineers find out why.
- Uses tools like:
  - X-rays
  - Microscopes
- Helps fix design or process problems.

## 🧪 1. Processing Zone (Clean Room: ISO Class 6 & 7)

- This is where the **main packaging operations** happen.
- Cleanrooms maintain very low dust levels to avoid contamination.
- Key processes done here:
  - Die bonding
  - Wire bonding or flip-chip bonding
  - RDL (Redistribution Layer) formation
  - Encapsulation (molding)
- Inspections are regularly done during and after these processes.

---

## 🔎 2. Inspection Area

- Integrated into the process flow.
- Used to check:
  - Bond quality
  - Die alignment
  - Surface defects
  - Overall package quality

> ✅ Packages are loaded onto trays after singulation (separating them from the wafer or panel).

---

## 🔌 3. Testing Area

- Chips are tested **after packaging**.
- Tests include:
  - Electrical functionality
  - Burn-in (high temperature stress)
  - Reliability (long-term usage checks)
- Equipment includes:
  - Test boards
  - Sockets for each package type
  - Chambers for thermal cycling
 
  

---

## 📌 Terms

- **Package Board**: A test board where packaged chips are mounted during electrical testing.
- **Package Socket**: Special connectors that hold the chip in place for repeatable and safe testing.
