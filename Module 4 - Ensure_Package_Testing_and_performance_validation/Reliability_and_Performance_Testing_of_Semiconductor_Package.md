# 🔥 Burn-in Test



## 🎯 Objective
To test semiconductor packages under **elevated stress conditions** (temperature, voltage, power cycling) to detect early-life failures, also known as **"Infant Mortality"**.

---

## 🧪 What is Burn-in?

Burn-in involves running the components in **stressful environments** to **accelerate failure mechanisms**, ensuring that **only reliable devices** reach the customer.

### Key Parameters:
- **High temperature**
- **High voltage**
- **Power cycling**

---

## 🔄 Burn-in Process

1. ✅ **Parts loaded from trays** onto **Burn-in Boards**.
2. 🔁 Boards are placed in **Burn-in Ovens** (Burn-in System).
3. ⚡ **Stress conditions applied** for a specific duration.
4. 📉 Parts are monitored to **identify early failures**.

---

## 📈 Why Burn-in?

- Detects:
  - **Dielectric breakdown**
  - **Metallization failures**
  - **Electromigration**
- Screens out parts likely to fail **early in the field**.

> ⚠️ Burn-in slightly **reduces the component's total lifespan**, but ensures **early reliability**.

# 🧪 Final Test using ATE & Handler

## 🎯 Objective
To validate the **electrical performance of a packaged IC** under **temperature extremes** (hot and cold corners) using **Automated Test Equipment (ATE)**.

---

## ⚙️ What is ATE?

**ATE (Automated Test Equipment)** is used to perform precise electrical tests on semiconductor devices.

- ✅ Measures performance across functional parameters
- 🔁 Ensures compliance with **specifications and datasheets**
- 🧠 Used in conjunction with a **handler** to automate DUT (Device Under Test) placement

---

## 🧊🧯 Temperature Corner Testing

Performed under **temperature-controlled conditions** (not ovens), to simulate realistic use cases.

### 🔥 Hot Test
- Parts are tested at **elevated temperatures**.
- Verifies **electrical behavior** meets high-temp specifications.

### ❄️ Cold Test
- Parts are tested at **low temperatures**.
- Ensures components function reliably under cold environmental conditions.

---

## 🧳 Equipment Used

- **Handler**: Loads and places ICs into ATE sockets at the correct temperature.
- **Test Fixture**: Maintains the temperature and interfaces the DUT with ATE.
- **ATE System**: Executes functional and parametric tests automatically.

---

## 📄 Specification Check (Example: LM741 OpAmp)

Based on the **datasheet absolute maximum ratings** and **electrical characteristics**:
- Input offset voltage
- Supply current
- Slew rate
- Output swing
- Gain bandwidth

> ✅ Final Test ensures the device performs within guaranteed limits before shipping.
