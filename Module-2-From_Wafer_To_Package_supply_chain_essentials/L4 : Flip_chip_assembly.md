#  Flip Chip Packaging Flow – Advanced Semiconductor Packaging

**Flip chip packaging** is an advanced technique in which the active side of the silicon die is flipped to face the substrate, allowing direct electrical connections via bumps. This approach enables **higher performance**, **better thermal management**, and **smaller form factors** compared to traditional wire bonding.

##  Step-by-Step Flip Chip Packaging Process

### 1️ Bump Formation on Silicon
- **Metal bumps** (usually solder or copper) are formed directly on the die pads using techniques like **electroplating**, **screen printing**, or **evaporation**.
- These bumps act as the **interconnects** between the die and the substrate.
- Bumps are arranged in a **grid array** to support **high I/O density**.

---

### 2️ Flipping the Chip
- The die is **flipped upside down**, so the bumped side (active side) faces the substrate.
- This orientation allows the bumps to directly contact corresponding pads on the substrate.

---

### 3️ Ball Mounting on Chip
- **Solder balls** (or additional bumps) may be mounted onto the die or the interposer if needed, depending on the specific package type (e.g., 2.5D or 3D IC).
- This enables **multi-chip modules** or vertical stacking in advanced packaging.

---

### 4️ Flux Dispense
- **Flux** is dispensed onto the substrate to aid the soldering process.
- It removes **oxidation**, improves **wettability**, and ensures **strong metallurgical bonding** during reflow.

---

### 5️ Chip Placement
- The flipped die is **aligned and placed** on the substrate with precise positioning.
- The bumps on the die must align with the **substrate bond pads**.

---

### 6️ Solder Reflow
- The assembly is **heated in a reflow oven**.
- The solder bumps **melt and re-solidify**, creating strong electrical and mechanical connections between the die and the substrate.
- **Self-alignment** occurs during reflow due to surface tension.

---

### 7️ Flux Cleaning
- After reflow, **residual flux** is removed using solvents or deionized water in **automated cleaning systems**.
- This is critical to prevent **corrosion** or **electrical shorts**.

---

### 8️ Underfill Dispense
- A **liquid epoxy underfill** is dispensed into the gap between the die and the substrate.
- This provides **mechanical support**, absorbs **thermal stress**, and improves **reliability** under thermal cycling.

---

### 9️ Underfill Cure
- The underfill is **thermally cured** in an oven, hardening the material.
- The cured underfill creates a **solid mechanical bond** that enhances package durability.

---

### 10 Molding
- An optional **molding compound** is applied over the assembly to protect the chip from moisture, contamination, and mechanical damage.
- Common in **wafer-level or fan-out packages**.

---

### 11 Laser Marking
- The molded package is **laser-marked** with important info like lot number, part number, or company logo.
- This step supports **traceability** and **quality control**.

---

### 12 Ball Mount on Substrate
- **Final solder balls** are mounted on the **bottom side of the substrate**, creating the **BGA (Ball Grid Array)** interface for board-level mounting.
- This step enables **surface mount technology (SMT)** compatibility with PCBs.
