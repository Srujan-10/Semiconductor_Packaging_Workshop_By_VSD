#  Wafer Preparation Process â€“ ISO Class 7 Cleanroom

This repository documents the wafer preparation flow inside a cleanroom environment (ISO Class 7), typically used in semiconductor fabrication facilities. It outlines each key step from wafer arrival to packaging readiness.

##  Process Flow

### 1. Incoming Wafer Carrier
- Wafers arrive sealed in specialized carriers to prevent contamination.

### 2. Wafer Inspection
- Visual or automated inspection for cracks, particles, and surface defects.

### 3. Wafer Front Tape Lamination
- Protective tape is laminated onto the front side of the wafer to safeguard it during grinding.

### 4. Wafer Backside Grinding
- The backside of the wafer is ground down to reduce thickness, enabling easier packaging and improved electrical performance.

### 5. Tape Frame Mounting (Backside)
- The wafer is attached to a tape frame on its backside to stabilize it during the dicing process.

### 6. Wafer Dicing (Two-Step)
- **Laser Grooving**: Laser creates shallow pre-cuts along scribe lines.
- **Blade Dicing**: High-precision blade cuts the wafer into individual dies.

### 7. Inspection and Statistical Process Control (SPC)
- Quality control check and yield tracking using SPC techniques.

### 8. Wafer Ready to be Packaged
- The wafer is cleaned and prepared for final packaging.
