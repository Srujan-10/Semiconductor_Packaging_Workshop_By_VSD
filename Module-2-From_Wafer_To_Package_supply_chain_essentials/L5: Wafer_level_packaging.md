#  Fan-Out Wafer Level Packaging (FO-WLP) – Full Process Flow

**Fan-Out Wafer Level Packaging (FO-WLP)** is an advanced packaging method that allows integration of a known good die (KGD) into a reconstituted wafer and builds interconnects through **Redistribution Layers (RDLs)**. It is highly beneficial for size reduction, higher I/O count, and better electrical performance.

## Full FO-WLP Flow Overview

### 1️ Known Good Die (KGD) Selection
- Dies are tested at the wafer level to select only **defect-free (known good dies)** for packaging.
- Ensures high yield in the final packaged product.

---

### 2️ Pick and Place of Known Good Dies
- Selected dies are **picked and placed** on a **temporary carrier** in predefined positions.
- Placement uses high-precision machines for proper alignment.

---

### 3️ Reconstitution Process
- The **dies are embedded** into an **Epoxy Molding Compound (EMC)** on the carrier, forming a **reconstituted wafer**.
- This process is called **fan-out reconstitution** and allows additional space around each die for routing.

---

### 4️ Carrier Support
- A **temporary carrier** (glass or silicon) holds the reconstituted wafer during RDL buildup.
- Acts as a **mechanical support** throughout wafer processing.

---

### 5️ Dielectric Coating
- A **dielectric material** is spin-coated on the reconstituted wafer.
- Provides **electrical insulation** for the upcoming metal layers.

---

### 6️ 1st RDL Patterning
- First **Redistribution Layer (RDL)** is patterned to redistribute I/O pads to a larger area.
- Involves **photoresist coating, lithography, and metal deposition**.

---

### 7️ 2nd RDL Patterning
- A second dielectric layer is added, followed by **2nd RDL** creation for multi-layer routing.
- Allows **routing flexibility** and **higher I/O count**.

---

### 8️ 3rd RDL Patterning (If Required)
- For complex or multi-chip modules, a **third RDL** may be added.
- Enables **dense interconnects** and **heterogeneous integration**.

---

### 9️ Solder Ball Attach
- **Solder balls** are mounted on the final RDL pads to allow SMT mounting to PCB.
- Also referred to as **ball grid array (BGA)** formation.

---

### 10 Carrier Release
- The **temporary carrier** is removed, leaving only the functional reconstituted wafer.
- This is done through thermal or chemical means without damaging the package.

---

### 1️1 Laser Marking
- Each individual package is marked using **laser technology** with serial numbers, barcodes, or logos.
- Facilitates **traceability** and **quality control**.

---

### 1️2 Singulation
- The reconstituted wafer is **diced/singulated** into individual Fan-Out WLP units.
- Dies are now ready to be shipped or mounted on a PCB.
