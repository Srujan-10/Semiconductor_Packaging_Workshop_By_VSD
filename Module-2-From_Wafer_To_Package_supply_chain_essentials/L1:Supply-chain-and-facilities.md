# 🧼 Wafer Preparation Process – ISO Class 7 Cleanroom

This repository documents the wafer preparation flow inside a cleanroom environment (ISO Class 7), typically used in semiconductor fabrication facilities. It outlines each key step from wafer arrival to packaging readiness.

## 📋 Process Flow

### 1. Incoming Wafer Carrier
- Wafers arrive sealed in specialized carriers to prevent contamination.

### 2. Wafer Inspection
- Visual or automated inspection for cracks, particles, and surface defects.

### 3. Wafer Front Tape Lamination
- Protective tape is laminated onto the front side of the wafer to safeguard it during grinding.

### 4. Wafer Backside Grinding
- The backside of the wafer is ground down to reduce thickness, enabling easier packaging and improved electrical performance.

### 5. Tape Frame Mounting (Backside)
- The wafer is attached to a tape frame on its backside to stabilize it during the dicing process.

### 6. Wafer Dicing (Two-Step)
- **Laser Grooving**: Laser creates shallow pre-cuts along scribe lines.
- **Blade Dicing**: High-precision blade cuts the wafer into individual dies.

### 7. Inspection and Statistical Process Control (SPC)
- Quality control check and yield tracking using SPC techniques.

### 8. Wafer Ready to be Packaged
- The wafer is cleaned and prepared for final packaging.

## 🏭 Key Functional Zones in a Packaging Plant

### 🔧 Process Zone
- The **core area** where all critical wafer preparation and packaging steps take place under cleanroom conditions.  
- ISO-certified zones for grinding, dicing, die attach, wire bonding, etc.

### 🧪 Testing Area
- Area designated for **electrical and functional testing** of packaged ICs or bare dies.  
- Includes ATE (Automated Test Equipment) setups, burn-in chambers, and probe stations.

### 🧰 Material Preparation & Storage
- Prepares raw materials (tapes, die attach pastes, bonding wires, etc.) for cleanroom entry.  
- Stores components and consumables under controlled conditions.

### 🔌 Utility & Maintenance Room
- Houses **equipment utilities** (e.g., chillers, vacuum systems, gas supplies) and **maintenance tools**.  
- Isolated from clean areas to avoid particle contamination.

### 📦 Warehouse
- Stores **incoming wafers**, outgoing finished goods, and packaging material.  
- Zoned separately from clean and process areas. Tracks inventory and logistics.

## 🧠 Notes

- This process is executed under stringent cleanroom protocols to avoid contamination.
- ISO Class 7 cleanrooms maintain less than 10,000 particles (≥0.5 µm) per cubic foot of air.
