# 🏭 Key Functional Zones in a Packaging Plant
---

### 🔧 Process Zone
- The **core area** where all critical wafer preparation and packaging steps take place under cleanroom conditions.  
- ISO-certified zones for grinding, dicing, die attach, wire bonding, etc.

### 🧪 Testing Area
- Area designated for **electrical and functional testing** of packaged ICs or bare dies.  
- Includes ATE (Automated Test Equipment) setups, burn-in chambers, and probe stations.

### 🧰 Material Preparation & Storage
- Prepares raw materials (tapes, die attach pastes, bonding wires, etc.) for cleanroom entry.  
- Stores components and consumables under controlled conditions.

### 🔌 Utility & Maintenance Room
- Houses **equipment utilities** (e.g., chillers, vacuum systems, gas supplies) and **maintenance tools**.  
- Isolated from clean areas to avoid particle contamination.

### 📦 Warehouse
- Stores **incoming wafers**, outgoing finished goods, and packaging material.  
- Zoned separately from clean and process areas. Tracks inventory and logistics.

## 🧠 Notes

- This process is executed under stringent cleanroom protocols to avoid contamination.
- ISO Class 7 cleanrooms maintain less than 10,000 particles (≥0.5 µm) per cubic foot of air.
